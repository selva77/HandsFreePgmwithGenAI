## Google Workspace Scripts for Weekly Status Reporting

This repository contains Google Workspace Scripts designed to automate and enhance the creation, distribution, and archival of weekly status reports.

**Key Features**

* **threeSendWsrReminderEmailsFileGenAI()**
    * Sends automated email reminders to contributors to update their status in the report.
    * Employs an AI model (through Google's Generative Language API) to summarize the most important updates, providing a concise snapshot of progress.

* **sendWsrEmail()**
    * Fetches your weekly status report from a Google Drive folder.
    * Extracts key updates from a designated "Key Topics" slide within Google Slides using SlidesApp.
    * Leverages an AI model (through Google's Generative Language API) to summarize the impactful updates, focusing on those related to BigQuery, Composer, HA/DR, and security.
    * Automatically creates a draft email in Gmail including the attached status report and the AI-generated summary.

* **wsrCopyAndRename()**
    * Archives previous versions of the weekly status report, ensuring historical records. 

**How to Use**

1. **Set up your Google Workspace environment:**
   * Create a folder in Google Drive to store your weekly status reports. Note the folder ID.
   * Create a Google Slides file to serve as your status report template, including a slide titled "Speech to Text Program Status Overview" (or update the script if your key topics slide has a different title).
   * Update the `folderId`, `archiveFolderId`, and `myApiKey` variables in the code with the respective values.

2. **Schedule the scripts to run automatically:**
   * Go to `Tools -> Script Editor` in your Google Spreadsheet.
   * Under `Triggers`, set up the scripts to run on a schedule that aligns with your reporting workflow. Consider scheduling `sendWsrEmail()` to run after `threeSendWsrReminderEmailsFileGenAI()` to allow time for updates.
